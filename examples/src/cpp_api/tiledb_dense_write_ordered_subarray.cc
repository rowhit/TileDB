 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * It shows how to read from a dense array, constraining the read
 * to a specific subarray. The cells are copied to the
 * input buffers sorted in row-major order within the selected subarray.
 *
 * You need to run the following to make it work:
 *
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_create
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_write_global_1
 * $ ./tiledb_dense_read_ordered_subarray
